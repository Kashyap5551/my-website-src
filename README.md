This is the repo of my personal website.

I have built it using react.js , node.js and tailwind.css.

I have incorporated Email.js to configure the 'Contact me' part of the website.

I have used google's icon and map api.

This started off as a side project. However, it ended up being beautiful enough for me to deploy it.
